<b> Trivia Game Application</b> 

This project is a quiz game built with React and TypeScript, providing an interactive user experience where players can answer random trivia questions. The app uses the Open Trivia API to fetch questions from various categories. This project combines these tools to create a responsive and user-friendly quiz game that updates scores and provides feedback. 

<b> Technologies and Frameworks Used: </b>
<b> React:</b> Utilized for building the app's user interface, including the interactive question-and-answer components, score updates, and feedback visuals for correct/incorrect answers. <br />
<b> TypeScript:</b> Ensures type safety across the codebase, enabling a more robust development process with minimized runtime errors. <br />
<b> Context API:</b> Manages global state efficiently across different components, helping to handle current questions, user scores, and game settings without prop drilling. <br /> 
<b> Reducers:</b> Used in combination with the Context API to manage and update game state, such as user answers and score tallying, through a functional approach. <br />
<b> Visual Studio Code (VSCode):</b> Serves as the primary development environment. <br /> 
<b>NPM:</b> Facilitates dependency management and package installations. <br /> 
<b>HTML & CSS:</b> Provides the structural and stylistic foundation of the app, creating a visually appealing and responsive UI. <br /> <br /> 
<b>Vite:</b> Used as a fast, modern development server for quickly running and testing the app during development. <br />
